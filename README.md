# Multivariate ML APPROACHES for Dynamic prediction of air quality and estimating heatwave occurrence

Pollutants in the air lead to degradation in the air quality which leads to global warming and unpredictable heatwave occurrence. Air pollution has been a leading cause of respiratory diseases and premature deaths. To forecast AQI and temperature, a multivariate approach based on AR-Net and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) is proposed. A combination of atmospheric and meteorological variables as input features to train the model, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2). Open-source dataset of Air quality in India, is used to train the models and evaluate the experiments. 	 With an MAPE of 7% for AQI and MAPE of 4%for heatwave prediction, it is concluded that the results demonstrate appreciable accuracy in predicting AQI and the occurrence of heatwaves.
